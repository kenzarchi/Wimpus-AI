# Wumpus-AI
The Wumpus world is a simple world example to illustrate the worth of a knowledge-
based agent and to represent knowledge representation. It was inspired by a video
   game
by Gregory Yob in 1973.
 In this project my teammate Asmae Dalil and I worked on the coding of a logical
agent for the Wumpus game, using Prolog, a logic programming language associated
  with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics
